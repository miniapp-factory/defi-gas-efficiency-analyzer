App Name: DeFi Gas Efficiency Analyzer

Description:
DeFi Gas Efficiency Analyzer is a Mini App that monitors and analyzes gas consumption across DeFi protocols and transactions. Track which protocols, pools, or transaction types are most efficient, and receive alerts for high gas usage or optimization opportunities.

Key Features:
 • Real-time tracking of gas consumption across DeFi protocols
 • Alerts for unusually high gas usage or spikes
 • Historical gas usage charts and efficiency metrics
 • Comparison of protocols and transaction types
 • Dashboard to identify cost-saving opportunities

Use Case:
Ideal for DeFi users, traders, and developers who want to optimize transaction costs, choose efficient protocols, and minimize unnecessary gas spending.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` constants to match the new app description.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to generate the app logo image.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create the logo generation file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.  
Please add that file to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it.

I need the current contents of **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** so I can replace the `title` and `description` values.  
Please add that file to the chat, then I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks and the new `logo.png.todo` file.
